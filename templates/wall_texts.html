{% block content_subtitle %}In the game's, in areas with treasure chests sometimes have writings on the wall which are different than the ones in the game's starting area. Here you can find the meaning of these panels and read the thoughts of our dear poet/cleric/script and his social commentary on the world of Phantom Abyss.<br>For some panels, we aren't sure what the meaning is yet and they are marked as <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">Tentative</span> or <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-light">Not yet translated</span>.<br>
<br>
If you would like to help translating the texts or think we have something wrong (we probably do!), please come join the conversation on the <a href="https://discord.gg/phantomabyss">discord</a> in the <code>#ancient-language</code> channel! We’d love to hear your voice<br>{% endblock %}
